title: 'Code in Discord'
---

As with most of the tech world, I've been finding myself learning how to be efficient with tools like Claude Code, Amp, Goose, and others to write code quickly. Models have come a long way, and when you have a good workflow and a good understanding of what the agent can do, it's a very powerful tool.

This is great when I can sit down at my desk and write prompts in amp, or ask ChatGPT how it might structure some logic, and troubleshoot where I'm sitting. Lately, I find myself not at my desk as much as I would want to get ideas into a terminal. You might be starting to see where I'm going with this, given the title and all.

I use Discord for a lot of things - chatting with friends, building fun little bots that do various small tasks, and so on. But what if I could also use it to write code? Come along with me while I found out just how well that does (or doesn't) work!
