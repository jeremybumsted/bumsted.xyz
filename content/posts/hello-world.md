Why hello there, this is my first go at trying to write things down and doing a blog, share my thoughts in public, and generally move toward
the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) style of being social on the internet. Other than my LinkedIn which I use for work purposes, I don't have any sort of social media - but this is a way for me to journal, share my thoughts, and maybe someone out there will find something useful!

## Who am I?

Just another nerd on the web. I've been in the technology space for over 10 years, with a focus on highly technical customer support.

At the moment, I lead the Americas support team over at [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com). I'm also working on a side project (tentatively) called [bundi](https://bundi.ca) - an app that adds a privacy layer over email/sms messaging.
